Hi, I'm Mimi Lau — a full stack software engineer based in London, UK.

My journey began in 2011 as a web designer, crafting HTML and CSS websites. In 2016, I transitioned into <b>front-end</b> development, gaining valuable experience at startups like [Aftership](https://www.aftership.com) and digital agencies such as [Red Ant Asia](https://asia.redant.com). These roles strengthened my technical skills, deepened my understanding of user-centric design, and enhanced my ability to communicate effectively in fast-paced teams.

In 2021, I made a big leap — relocating to the UK and joining [Red Ant UK](https://www.redant.com/) as a <b>full stack</b> software developer. It was a major change, with a new culture, language, and tech stack to adapt to, but it’s been an incredibly rewarding experience that I’m truly grateful for.
