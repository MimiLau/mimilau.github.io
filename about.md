Hi! I'm Mimi from Hong Kong.

I have a background in web development and experience of successfully designing a websites layout, usability and appearance.

Over the last few years, I’ve had the opportunity of working in web design companies, marketing consultancy,  media company and Startup, this has given me extensive web designing knowledge and technical skills.

I also possess excellent communication skills and am comfortable working on projects as part of a team or individually.

I know most of the languages for web designing, eg. PHP, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap, SQL . I am very familiar with the open source CMS program WordPress. Over the past few years, I have been "working with" WordPress and Google very closely.

I mostly work directly for and with other designers/agencies to translate their creative work into responsive HTML/CSS templates or fully functional WordPress themes.

I work with Adobe, SASS, Sketch, HTML5/CSS3 & Javascript. I have a working knowledge of popular frameworks like Bootstrap, Nodejs and know my way around version management and working in SCRUM teams.

As of Nov 4st 2016 I’m available for short & longer term opportunities.
