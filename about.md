Hi! I'm Mimi from Hong Kong.

Everything started from 2011, I was a web designer making HTML/CSS websites. After that I had the best year of my life for Working Holiday in Australia.

In 2013 I joined to [Adams](http://www.adamshk.com) the marketing agency working as between web designer and programmer, until then I freelance for about 8 months on my own. Building up lots of practical experience of successful designed websites layout, usability and appearance.

In 2016 I started to shift my skills to front-end development. My experience in the startup [Aftership](https://www.aftership.com) and [Red Ant](https://asia.redant.com) the digital agency has given me extensive technical skills and web designing knowledge, along with excellent communication skills.

## Skills

I know most of the languages for web designing, eg. `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `Javascript`, `Bootstrap`, `SQL`, `PHP`, etc. In my past experience as a freelancer and working for agencies, I mostly created responsive websites with the open source CMS program `WordPress`, as well as knowing how to efficiently manage project and work with clients and colleagues successfully.

When the time I worked in startup, my front-end build process involves the popular frameworks like `Bootstrap-v4`, `Nodejs`, the javascript library `React` for building user interfaces, and the use of tools such as `Sass`, `Grunt` and `NPM` to speed up development. And know my way around version management and working in `SCRUM` teams.

## Coding style

I love to write reusable, clean and maintainable code.

I adapted to `ESLint` to check for errors on javascript. The rules in use are shamelessly taken from Airbnb's Javascript Style guide.

`SCSS` will be the first choice of writing css because I'm in love with the usable assets like variable and mixins. And through a simple pre-processor to generate css for different vendor versions.
