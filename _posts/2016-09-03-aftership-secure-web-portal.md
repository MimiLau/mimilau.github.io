The site is fully featured using latest technologies, the most challenging part was to allow a single element to animate and update its content across completely separate pages. The task has been accomplished by using Redux to flow data from the router and sync the sliding animations with each page on enter and leave.

The site also feature a full SSR (Server Side Render) which make it load faster and usable even with JavaScript disabled.

All the animations are spring based, apart from those one of my favourite bits is the interactive canvas on the our focus page.

provide the front-end with restful APIs.
