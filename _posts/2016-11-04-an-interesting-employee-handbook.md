When the time I was buried with the office culture, one of my colleague introduced me a book.

This is a handbook for new employee in Valve, a gaming company in Washington, telling them what to do when no one’s there telling theme what to do.

## Why no one is telling theme what to do?

Because they don't have a manager!

Valve trust employees, they pushed forward by employee's self-motivation and passion.

> Since Valve is flat, people don’t join projects because they’re told to. Instead, you’ll decide what to work on after asking yourself the right questions (more on that later). Employees vote on projects with their feet (or desk wheels).

## Inspired by the book
Freedom and Independency are most important for one's growth. Everybody should have chance to be a decision maker in life so they could take responsibility of what they can. Blah Blah Blah

## Read the book
