When the time I was buried with the office culture, one of my colleague introduced me a book.

This is a handbook for new employee in [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/), a gaming company in Washington, telling them what to do when no one’s there telling theme what to do.

## They don't have a manager

Valve trust employees, they pushed forward by employee's self-motivation and passion.

> Since Valve is flat, people don’t join projects because they’re told to. Instead, you’ll decide what to work on after asking yourself the right questions (more on that later). Employees vote on projects with their feet (or desk wheels).

## Inspiration

Freedom and Independency are both important for one's growth.

Large company which has all the rules and track for solutions, leading employees to have less space to cultivate own mind. But company that run self-management model will probably provides an environment for staff to maximize their ability.

Let yourself to be a decision maker, take responsibility of what you can. That will even amazed yourself by your deeper power.
