This is a Front-end project which use `Pug` template to generate HTML files. `Grunt` tasks are set to minified js and css files.

Project is sent to a outsource company to perform the Wordpress backend and it works perfect.

Effects are made by jquery and some javascript & css libraries like `animate.css`, `skrollr`, `snap` and etc. `Preloadjs` is introduced to manage and co-ordinate the loading of assets and data.

We are going to submit this site to [AWWWARDS](http://www.awwwards.com/) and hope to see you there soon!
