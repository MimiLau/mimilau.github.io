Aftership is a shipment tracking application and API for eCommerce retailers and buyers.

This site is written in `Express` as the `Node.js` web framework. We use `Jade` (Now it's renamed to `Pug`) as the template engine. Compiling Jade files in grunt tasks.

We grabbed all the designs in `Sketch` from UX/UI designers. Styles are written in Bootstrap-v4 in `BEM` approach.

The code is well organized by HTML5 semantic elements, for more SEO-friendly site structure.

This is the first project when I entered this company where I developed my front-end skills. The most challenging part is to pick up new technologies that I have not used before. But I kinda enjoy those because the tools actually help writing static site more faster and cleaner, lead to a more quality product we have. I would say finishing up this project is a huge sense of success.
