PharmaOS is a pharmacovigilance platform designed to help pharmaceutical companies manage patient safety data during clinical trials and product launches. It provides a unified system for tracking, reporting, and analyzing safety information.

As a developer, I develop and maintain this platform with a focus on stability and scalability. I implement solutions that support multiple organizations with minimal disruption, preserving consistency for a long-standing client relationship of over 20 years. I also ensure that the platform's design and accessibility comply with government standards and guidelines.
