RetailOS is an integrated application that helps retailers streamline operations, personalize customer interactions, and drive sales. It enhances both in-store and online experiences by unifying key retail functions into a single platform.

As a developer on the Retail team at Red Ant, I contributed to building and enhancing features tailored to customer needs â€” from implementing new functionality to improving performance and user experience.

This is not only a web app, but also an ios app.
