I"¶<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Mimi from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Everything started from 2011, I was a web designer making HTML/CSS websites. After that I had the best year in my life for Working Holiday in Australia.</p>

<p>In 2013 I joined to <a href="http://www.adamshk.com">Adams</a> the marketing agency working as between web designer and programmer, until then I freelance for about 8 months on my own. Building up lots of practical experience of successful designed websites layout, usability and appearance.</p>

<p>In 2016 I started to shift my skills to front-end development. My experience in the startup <a href="https://www.aftership.com">Aftership</a> and <a href="https://asia.redant.com">Red Ant</a> the digital agency has given me extensive technical skills and web designing knowledge, along with excellent communication skills.</p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>I know most of the languages for web designing, eg. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTML5</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSS3</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Javascript</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bootstrap</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SQL</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PHP</code>, etc. In my past experience as a freelancer and working for agencies, I mostly created responsive websites with the open source CMS program <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WordPress</code>, as well as knowing how to efficiently manage project and work with clients and colleagues successfully.</p>

<p>When the time I worked in startup, my front-end build process involves the popular frameworks like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">React</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">React Native</code> along with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Redux</code> for building javascript apps, and the use of tools such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sass</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Grunt</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NPM</code> to speed up development. Also know my way around version management and working in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCRUM</code> teams.</p>

<h2 id="coding-style">Coding style</h2>

<p>I love to write reusable, clean and maintainable code.</p>

<p>I adapted to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ESLint</code> to check for errors on javascript. The rules in use are shamelessly taken from Airbnbâ€™s Javascript Style guide.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCSS</code> will be the first choice of writing css because Iâ€™m in love with the usable assets like variable and mixins. And through a simple pre-processor to generate css for different vendor versions.</p>
