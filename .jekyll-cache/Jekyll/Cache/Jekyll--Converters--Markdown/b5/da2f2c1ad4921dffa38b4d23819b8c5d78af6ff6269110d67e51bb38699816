I"ù<p>When the time I was buried with the office culture, one of my colleague introduced me a book.</p>

<p>This is a handbook for new employee in <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Valve</a>, a gaming company in Washington, telling them what to do when no oneâ€™s there telling theme what to do.</p>

<h2 id="they-dont-have-a-manager">They donâ€™t have a manager</h2>

<p>Valve trust employees, they pushed forward by employeeâ€™s self-motivation and passion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since Valve is flat, people donâ€™t join projects because theyâ€™re told to. Instead, youâ€™ll decide what to work on after asking yourself the right questions (more on that later). Employees vote on projects with their feet (or desk wheels).</p>

<p>Freedom and Independency are both important for oneâ€™s growth.</p>

<p>Large company which has all the rules and track for solutions, leading employees to have less space to cultivate own mind. But company that run self-management model will probably provides an environment for staff to maximize their ability.</p>

<p>Let yourself to be a decision maker, take responsibility of what you can. That will even amazed yourself by your deeper power.</p>
